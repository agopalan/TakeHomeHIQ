Assignment:
1)Create a google image Android App
Create a single page app that replicates a basic google image search.  There should 
be a text field that accepts a search parameter and a way to display images from the resulting query.  
You can be creative with the display interface as time allows.  If you want to only display 1 image, 
that is fine. If you want to create an animated image browser that uses the accelerometer to 
navigate or something crazy like that, go for it. Your project only needs to run in the simulator.
